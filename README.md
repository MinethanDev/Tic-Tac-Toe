## Details
I just wanted to recreate the tic-tac-toe game in my spare time using the pygame library. Not much to say except that it's a very common tic-tac-toe...

## How to play
You'd have to have an IQ of 2 not to know how to play tic-tac-toe... But you'll need pygame to run it:

Just type `pip install pygame` in your terminal and enjoy !
